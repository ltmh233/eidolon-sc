"""Gifts (GLOSSARY.md「礼物」「抽奖」「重置卡」): each user's draw chances, what they have drawn
and their reset cards, the one way into them for the gifts page and the admin console, but
for drawing and giving, which count towards the daily tasks and the achievements and so are
kept with them (`happenings.Happenings.draw`, `Happenings.give`).

Draw chances are given one a day (`affinity.DRAWS_PER_DAY`) as the day begins, at midnight
Beijing time wherever the user is (`affinity.day_of`), kept up to `affinity.MAX_DRAWS`.
Nothing gives them on a schedule: whoever reads them first gives what the days since they
were last given have brought. A user without any yet is given one that day, new or not.

Gifts are open where affinity is (`LiveConfig.affinity_on`): the deployment has the judge
model and the switch「好感度和礼物」is on. Closed, what each user has is kept and read all
the same, but no chances are given; and the days it was closed give none once it opens
again, which gives one that day. So when it last opened is kept (`notice`), as the backend
starts and as the switch changes. That is no one's; what each user has is theirs, deleted
with them (`database.USER_DATA`).

A user is rewarded for what they do (`reward`), as daily tasks are done and achievements'
stages unlocked (`happenings`): each reward given once by its key, its draw chances over and
above the most kept of those given each day, and its reset cards, never anything of her
affinity. As the achievements launch, everyone is rewarded for what they did before, open
or not (`reward_everyone`).

An admin may give every user there is a reset card at once (`grant_reset_cards`), banned
ones and admins too, but no one user anything on their own. Each grant is kept, when and
how many, saying nothing of who granted it or to whom: that too is no one's.

Each draw uses a chance and gives a reset card or a gift, as likely as `affinity.DRAW_ODDS`
says, any of the rarity's gifts not retired as likely as another: nothing is guaranteed,
and whom a gift is liked by plays no part. Drawn gifts stack in the backpack, which keeps
them retired since or not. The numbers come from the random source the backend is built
with (`randomness.Random`). Drawing calls no model and leaves no activity record.
